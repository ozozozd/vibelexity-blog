Welcome to my blog! This is my first post using the [Terminal](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal) theme for Hugo.

## What is this?

This blog is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and deployed automatically to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

## Getting started

To create a new post, run:

```bash
hugo new content posts/my-new-post.md
```

Then edit the file and start writing!
